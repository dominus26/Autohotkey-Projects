# Autohotkey-Projects
different Autohotkey Projects I've dabbled in
* domtmp is a small program that runs over all the temporary folders of windows and users and deletes every unnecessary file. can save gb's of space. It also has a possibility to interface with ccleaner if you put it in a subdirectory of the executable, and will run ccleaner afterwards for maximum effect.
* mydocs is a small app that opens Documents directory, which you can also pin to task bar.
* domItbox/Itbox is a menu interface which generally comes with assorted applications in it's subdirectory and it's general purpose is computer maintenance and troubleshooting
* wfclose will 'softly' close waterfox - can be used as a scheduled task.
* killpr will delete all spool jobs waiting on a printer and restart the service
* defPrinter will delete unnecessary printers such as 'OneNote' and XPS, and will set a default printer on computer startup by name.
* DoitRemotely will retrieve details on a remote computer, based on WMI.
* הצילו - backend user environment tool to help user tackle problems by himself. The program has a gui in Hebrew and is oriented mostly towards my work place programs and environment, but can easily be adapted to any work place (closing unresponsive programs, restarting outlook, closing all internet explorer windows, automating cleanup of processes and temporary files to make computer work faster and more.)
