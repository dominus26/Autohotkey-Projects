# Autohotkey-Projects
different Autohotkey Projects I've dabbled in
* domtmp is a small program that runs over all the temporary folders of windows and users and deletes every unnecessary file. can save gb's of space. It also has a possibility to interface with ccleaner if you put it in a subdirectory of the executable, and will run ccleaner afterwards for maximum effect.
* mydocs is a small app that opens Documents directory, which you can also pin to task bar.
* domItbox/Itbox is a menu interface which generally comes with assorted applications in it's subdirectory and it's general purpose is computer maintenance and troubleshooting
* wfclose will 'softly' close waterfox - can be used as a scheduled task.
